The goal of this project is to create an application that can write and save notes. Bonus if it can be deleted. Front-end is created, the challenge is to build the back-end using Express.js and deploy the finished application to Heroku.

## Usage

* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note      title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

* THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

* WHEN I click on the Save icon

* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
